# PRODIGY_CS_01
This project is a Caesar Cipher program in Python.

It allows the user to:

Encrypt a message by shifting each letter forward in the alphabet by a given number (shift key).

Decrypt a message by shifting each letter backward using the same shift key.

It also keeps spaces and symbols unchanged, so sentences work normally.

Example:

Message: hello

Shift key: 3

Encrypted: khoor 2) Run the program
